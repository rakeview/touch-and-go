# touch-and-go
The interface for 3d manipulation of orthogonal cuboids via 2d finger touches.

## goals
1. allow for simple, intuitive editing
2. welcoming for first-time users
3. satisfying for experienced professionals
4. consistent interface

## strategies
1. focus on orthoganal cubioids
2. edit other volumes based on oriented bounding boxes, with a fixed orientation as you see fit.
3.
